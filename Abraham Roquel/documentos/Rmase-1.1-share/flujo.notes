	one may start prowler including the "prowler_v1_25" folder to the path and executing "prowler" on the command line

- simgui: with no arguments it launches the GUI


useful definitions:

- nargin
	returns the number of function input arguments fuven in the call to the currently executing function
	nargin(fun) returns the number of input arguments that appear in the fun function definition

- varargin
	is an input variable in a function definition statement that enables the function to accept any number of unput arguments. Specify varargin usinf lowercase charactes and inlude it as the last input argument after any explicitly declared inputs.

- varargout
	is an output variable in a funtion definition statement that enables the function to return any nuber of ouput arguments



n processing / forwarding nodes
links between pairs of nodes are viewed as bit pipes characterized by a bandwidth and a transmission delay
every node is of type store-andforward and has a a buffer where the incoming and outgoung packets are stored
	this buffer is a shared resource among all the queues
packets	are subdivided into two classes
	data
	routing
two priority levels in queues
	data packets in low priority
	routing packets in high priority
no disticntion amog nodes, they act at the same time as
	hosts
	routers
transport layer does no manage retransmissions or error handling

in the event of a packet coming
	node's routing component uses the local routing table to choose the outgoing link
	when the link resources beceom available, the are reserved and the transfer is set up
	if there is not enough buufer space to hold it, the packet is discarded
